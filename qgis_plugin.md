# QGIS Plugin

Adding many layers to a configuration file can be laborious, this is where `QGIS2Wegue` ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/meggsimum/qgis2wegue)) comes in handy. It converts all layers of a QGIS project into a valid Wegue configuration. This works for `WMS`, `XYZ`, `KML`, `GeoJSON`, `WFS`.
